# Visualization of Different Time-Series Data in the COVID-19 Pandemic

This is a project that my friends and I worked on for the final project of our Intro to Computer Science class. I was responsible for the coding of the project and editing the markdowns. 

The stock and crypto data were obtained from Yahoo Finance. The health data is obtained from the WHO website. 

In this project, I explored basic data, plotted, and experimented with data frames.
